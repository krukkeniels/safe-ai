# Copy this file:  cp docker-compose.override.yaml.example docker-compose.override.yaml
# Docker Compose automatically merges this with docker-compose.yaml.
#
# Common customizations:
#   - Pass API keys to the sandbox
#   - Mount local code into /workspace
#   - Use a pre-built image from your registry
#   - Mount corporate CA certificates
